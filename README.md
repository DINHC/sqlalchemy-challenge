Purpose: 
  
  1. Creating an IPYNB that analyzes stations, temperatures(min,max,avg), and precipitation data and 
      - Create one histogram graph for comparing date and precipitation data 
      - Create one bar graph showing temperature and frequency graphs 
  3. Make an app.py file that opens a site with different routes that contains data similar to stations, temperature, and precipitation data
      - List api routes on main page
      - Make route to precipitation, temperature, stations, start(min,max,avg) temp, and start to end (min,max,avg) temp
